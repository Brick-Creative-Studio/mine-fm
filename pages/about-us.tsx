        MINE.FM technology exists to make music discovery beneficial for both artists and fans connected through the communal appreciation of sound. Communities wonâ€™t form if kindred souls canâ€™t connect. We let music function as the signal for that connection.

        Our platform is for the creative and the crate-digger. We leverage decentralized tech and crypto to make sharing and listening to music more communal, more intentional, and more profitable.

        We believe the best way to make this impact is by bridging the divide between the physical and digital communities we interact with. We are bound by sound not distance ðŸŽ§
